# Godot 3 2D Fake Explosion Particles

A script to simulate exploding particles.

![Godot-3-2D-Fake-Explosion-Particles-GIF](examples/Godot-3-2D-Fake-Explosion-Particles.gif)

## Instalation

* [Download](https://github.com/hiulit/Godot-3-2D-Fake-Explosion-Particles/archive/master.zip) the repository ZIP file.
* Copy `fake_explosion_particles.tscn` and `fake_explosion_particles.gd`.

## Usage

Instance `fake_explosion_particles.tscn` and attach `fake_explosion_particles.gd` as a script.

You can of course use GDScript as well.

```
# Creata a new node.
var fake_explosion = Node2D.new()
fake_explosion.name = "fake_explosion"

# Attach the script.
fake_explosion.set_script(preload("res://path/to/fake_explosion_particles.gd"))

# Set 'fake_explosion' variables.
fake_explosion.min_particles_number = 5
fake_explosion.max_particles_number = 10
fake_explosion.min_particles_gravity = 20
fake_explosion.max_particles_gravity = 60
fake_explosion.min_particles_velocity = 20
fake_explosion.max_particles_velocity = 60
fake_explosion.min_particles_size = 1
fake_explosion.max_particles_size = 2
# etc ...

# Set its position
fake_explosion.position = Vector2(0, 0)

# This is useful if you want the explosion to be more visible.
fake_explosion.z_index = 1

# Add it to the scene.
get_parent().add_child(fake_explosion, true)

# And then you can explode it whenever you want.
fake_explosion.explode_particles = true

# You can use the name of the group to find all the fake particles nodes more easily.
get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("fake_explosion_particles")
```

You can change the colors of the particles, but you have to change them inside the script. They are set in `particles_colors_with_weights`.

The colors of the particles are chosen randomly depending on *weights*. If you want a color to have more probabilities to be chosen, give it a greater *weight*.

These are the defaults:

```
var particles_colors_with_weights = [
	[4, Color("#ffffff")],
	[2, Color("#000000")],
	[8, Color("#ff004d")],
	[8, Color("#ffa300")],
	[10, Color("#ffec27")]
]
```

## Parameters
